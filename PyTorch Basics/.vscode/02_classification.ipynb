    "# PyTorch NN Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "- A classification problem involves predicting whether something is one thing or another\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "    1. **Binary Classification**: Target can be one of 2 options, like yes or no. Predict whether someone has a heart disease based on their health parameters\n",
    "    2. **Multi-Class Classification**: Target can be one of 2+ options. Decide whether a photo is of food, a person, or a dog.\n",
    "    3. **Multi-Label Classification**: Target can be assigned more than one options. Predict what categories should be assigned to a Wikipedia article.\n",
    "- One of the most common ML algorithms along with regression\n",
    "- Here we cover the following:\n",
    "    1. Architecture of a classification NN\n",
    "    2. Getting binary classification data ready\n",
    "    3. Building a PyTorch Classification Model\n",
    "    4. Fitting the model to the data (training)\n",
    "    5. Making predictions and evaluating the model\n",
    "    6. IMproving a Model \n",
    "    7. Non-linearity\n",
    "    8. Replicating non-linear functions\n",
    "    9. Putting it altogether with multiclass classification\n",
    "\n",
    "# Architecture of Classification NN\n",
    "- Discussion of Hyperparameters:\n",
    "    1. Input Layer shape of ```in_features```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Make Classification Data and get it Ready\n",
    "- Let us begin by making data\n",
    "- We will use ```make_circles``` method from Skikit-Learn to generate two circles with different colored dots"
